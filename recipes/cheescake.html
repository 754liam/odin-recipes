        Description
    </h5>
    <p>
      A cheesecake is a rich and creamy dessert consisting of one or more layers, with the main and thickest layer being a mixture of soft, fresh cheese (typically cream cheese), eggs, and sugar. This filling usually rests upon a crust made from crushed cookies (like graham crackers) or sometimes pastry. Baked until set and often chilled, cheesecakes offer a delightful balance of tangy, sweet, and velvety textures.
